# LinAlgPowerMethod

This project aims to implement the Power Method to approximate the singular value decomposition (SVD) on matrix A of m x n by taking it to a reasonably high kth power. 

## Getting Started
The power_method.py is the code for the power method. One can run with 
```
python power_method.py
```
The write up details the history, stakes, and mathematical concepts behind the power method incorporated into SVD.
The images svd1.png and pm1.png are output screenshots used for the write up. 


## Running the tests

Any matrix represented as a list of list will work for testing. The user can compare the result of the power_method with the results returned by numpy.linalg.svd (template is set up in the main method)

## Built With
Python and numpy
